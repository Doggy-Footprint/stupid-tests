# Goal

For security purpose, I was requested to remove the key in memory using python.

But lots of modern language support immutable objects for sake of memory management and security.

In Python, `bytearray` solve the problem.

# Further

If you are interested, use `gcore` to dump memory as **dump_memory.sh** or run script after check :)
